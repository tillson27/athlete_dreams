# Validate Task Skill

Validate existing task planning documents to ensure they will actually achieve the stated objective correctly and completely.

## When to Use

- After the `$task-planning` (`/task-planning`) skill has produced context and steps documents
- When additional context or objective changes are provided
- When a second opinion on a task plan is needed before execution

## Required Inputs

1. **Task documents** — Path to existing context and/or steps documents in `.ai/tasks/`
2. **Additional context** (optional) — Any new information or objective changes

## Single Source of Control

- `{.ai,.claude,.codex}/skills/validate-task/CHECKLIST.md` — All validation requirements

## Provider Contract Validation Gate

For any third-party API that the plan calls, parses, or persists, run or verify the `$provider-contract-verification` (`/provider-contract-verification`) skill. Treat missing provider contract evidence as a validation failure.

## Workflow

1. Read the task documents provided.
2. Follow the checklist end-to-end.
3. Use source-of-truth docs, FireCrawl/Context7 when available, and web searches to verify technical approaches and assumptions.
4. Fix any issues directly in the documents.
5. Summarize what was validated and any changes made.
